## Assignment:

Same as for the previous week's assignment, in this week's assignment, you’ll be asked to essentially also re-do what we did during this week, and submit the Dapp that you'll be creating.

**Guiding steps:** 

1. Create a new Node Project
2. Add the Hardhat dependency into it 
3. Go into the contracts folder and create a new smart contract
- Create a new smart contract (not the Greeter one that we did during the course, you’re encouraged to experiment with the solidity programming language and what you want to achieve with your smart contract)
4. Modify your deploy script and the hardhat config file to be able to compile/deploy your smart contract later
5. Start a local node with hardhat in a new terminal (be sure to leave it running and continue your work in a new terminal)
6. Import one of the newly generated accounts into your Metamask wallet (you might want to delete the other account that you added during the previous assignment, as we won’t be able to even use it because the terminal in which we created the local nodes last time is probably closed)
7. Deploy your smart contract
8. Create a new React application and make the necessary changes to the interfaces according to what you want to display/achieve with your smart contract and your App
9. Implement the Metamask wallet authentication method when the application starts (or through a login button if you want to do so)
10. Import your Smart contract’s ABI into your new React app to be able to interact with the functions in your smart contract
11. Implement the functions into your app.js file to be able to communicate with your smart contract’s functions.

Once you're done, push your code to github, create a pull request and then submit the URL for it.
